# This program solves the FiveThirtyEight puzzle titled "How Many Ways Can you
# Cast A Die", which was published on July 15,2022. The puzzle can be found at:
# https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-ways-can-you-cast-a-die/
# The text is posted here in case the link is broken:
# I have an unlabeled, six-sided die. I make a single mark on the middle of each
# face that is parallel to one pair of that faceâ€™s four edges.
# How many unique ways are there for me to mark the die? (Note: If two ways can
# be rotated so that they appear the same, then they are considered to be the
# same marking.)
# Extra credit: Suppose you can also mark a face along one of its two diagonals.
# Now how many unique ways are there to mark the die?



## Gameplan
# If we ignored rotations, then this would be relatively straight forward. Each
# face could have 2 possibilties, so the number of possibilities would be
# 2^6, or 64. With the extra credit, that grows to 4^6, or 4096. Both are easily
# solved with brute force. So, the strategy is to weed out rotations. 
# This also sets our bounds. For the first section, our answer should be
# between 1 and 64. For the extra credit, between 1 and 4096.

# 1. We will create a virtual die whose markings will be either -1 or 1. These
# can change due to rotation. 
# 2. So, we will work out the different rotations and how they move the faces 
# and change the markings. 
# 3. Go through all combinations and weed out copies.
# 4. For extra credit, just add -2 and 2 as possibilities. Rotations are same.

# Note die reference frame: if die is sitting on a table, the x-y plan sits on
# the table and the z axis is perpindicular to the table. Right hand rule applies.
